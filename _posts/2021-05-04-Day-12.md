title: Day 12
---

For the past few days I Updated<a herf="https://trello.com/b/LmBfcXYU/project-scope">Scope board</a> and added cards to things i need to research and implement, i started researching networking APIs I looked at Photon API, Mirror API, Pun2 and finally 
I decided to go with MLAPI.
<br>
I am still researching more into it reading the documentation they released and watching videos to 
understand how to use the API correctly before I create my unity project.
<br>
I also added some tasks to be done in order to complete a prototype project.
<br>
I will not be focusing on code and art i just want to make a working network prototype of my game.
where you can start the game select an option and join/host a game session.
<br>
## Why MLAPI
MLAPI is the official unity approach to networking game Objects, and it will be much better to rely on it as it is still new (released on Apr 2021) and is adopted by Unity this will guarantee support for longer periods of time.
