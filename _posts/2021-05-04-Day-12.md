For the past few days I was researching unity networking I looked at photon API I looked at mirror API and finally 
I decided to go with Netcode using MLAPI it is the official API for game objects networking for unity it was released 
this year in May and I am still researching more into it reading the documentation they released and watching videos to 
understand how to use the API correctly before I start my unity project.
