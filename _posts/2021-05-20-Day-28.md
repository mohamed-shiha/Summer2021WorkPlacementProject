title: Day 28 - Playable prototype
---
This few days i researched animations and weapons animations but in the end i have a solid idea on how to animate my player, so for now i have a prototype player with no animations and i will be only focusing on making a networked playable prototype and as part of that i have a player that use a weapon and shoot a bullet that will hit an object and detect what object it's hitting.

The weapon will know it's own bullet and i have all the code for the weapon with reloading and fire rate all fixed with no bugs.

### Bullet
The bullet will use a Rigid body component and by adding force to it will move in the forward vector direction until it hits something or it will travel and gets destroyed for 1 second using a self distrust script.

### Player 
i added prototype scripts so i can test without changing anything in my "working script", this will help me develop the multiple methods to move and fire the weapon and in the end i will decide what is more suitable for my game.

### Final Result
showing the player looking around and firing bullets, and the added scripts.
