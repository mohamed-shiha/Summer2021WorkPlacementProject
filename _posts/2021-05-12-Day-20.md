title: Day 20 - Lobby/Team Select
---

Today i added team select to the lobby, including materials for each team and spawn location to each team so far i have 4 teams that can be used for the game mode 2v2v2v2.
currently the team will only be changed on the local instance of the game i will be adding messaging system from the client to the server to do the player customization.
## Data manager 
Data manger is a scrip to manage data that needs to be loaded and currently i am using it for the prototype player customization.

## Game Manager
This is a script to manage the game currently it will check if the game play scene is loaded and it will configure the match, currently it will spawn each player to the team spawn location.

### Final Result
As a result i can now spawn each player to the respective team spawn location.
