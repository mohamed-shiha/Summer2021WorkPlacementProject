title: Day 18 - Lobby
---

Today i added a lobby system so when a player connect or host a server it will go to a lobby to set all the game options the players can customize the character and only the host can set the match properties.

### lobby Options i have so far

there is not much to talk about but it took some time to implement as i was still familiarize my self with networking programming.
one of the challenges i overcome today was to determine if the this code is running on the server or the client and how to make sure that it will only run where i want it(some times only on the server and other times only on the clients), also some code need to run on the host as a client and also on the clients.

### Final Result
As a result i can now connect up to 7 clients to a server protected by a password 8 players in total.
