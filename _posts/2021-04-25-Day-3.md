Today I started making a list of what is the project scope and what i want to have in it 
I made a Trello board to keep track of what i want 
<a href="https://trello.com/b/LmBfcXYU/project-scope"> this board </a> will have everything i want to have in the game.
and then i will add some links to assets and resources that i need to achieve a selected feature.
