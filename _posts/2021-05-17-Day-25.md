title: Day 25 - Weapon Script and Animations
---

Today i wanted to focus on the player animation and shooting, I am aiming to have a fully playable prototype by the end of this month.
the goal is to have a playable character that can shoot, reload, die and kill all with networking.

Today i added a class to a parent of all the weapons i will later add to the game, the class will have all the properties needed for every weapon, with Fire and reload methods declared and implemented.

I also worked on animating the player movement but i i have not finished i will be working from now on on the player to build it up as it is going to be the most important object in my game.

I used [Mixamo](www.mixamo.com) to download animations and a placeholder character to be used in the prototype for now.

### Final Result
As a result i now Have a script to be a parent for all weapons and an Idle/Walking animation.
