title: Day 14 - Creating Prototype
---

Today I created a Unity project and installed MLAPI using <a href="https://docs-multiplayer.unity3d.com/docs/migration/install" target="_blank">This link,</a> and when I was researching i read that using a clone is much faster to test on the same computer so to do that I used a package called<a href="https://github.com/hwaet/UnityProjectCloner" target="_blank"> Unity Project Cloner from Github </a>.
It will created a clone from my project and apply the changes from the main project automatically to the clone this will make it easier form me to run 2 instance of the game and debug each one separately.   
<br>
Currently the project will run and create or join a localhost server, it will spawn a player that i created on both instances.
<br>
### Player prefab:
I also Created a player prefab to be the default player currently there are no scripts on it other then the network object script provided by MLAPI.
<br>
### Network Manager:
the main script i need to manage the network objects and connectivity is the one provided by the MLAPI called [NetworkManager](ahttps://mp-docs.dl.it.unity3d.com/docs/components/networkmanager). it will provide methods to start and join servers and it will manage the player spawning and spawn location.
