title: Day 36 - Finalizing Prototype
---
after weeks of debugging i was a ble to fix all network related bugs, now i have a clear vision on how network layer works in unity.
i have a<a href="/Summer2021WorkPlacementProject/AllForOneWin_FirstPrototype.apk" target="_blank"> downloadable APK file.</a> for the mobile to work I also added the ability to add a custom IP to (host/connect to). 


### Spawning
I fixed the respawning now at the beginning of the gameplay scene every player will spawn in his/her own team area, after getting eliminated by an enemy player the local player will spawn again in a random area by the server.
 
### Attack
The local player will press the fire button and it will call a fire method on the server then the server will call fire method from that player object on every client.

### Mobile input
Using the built in interface provided by unity i was able to implement a script to detect a long press or a toggle press on buttons in the player's UI, then using that script i added few buttons to control the player on mobile devices.

### Final Result
Showing the player moving, looking around, jumping and firing bullets on the phone.
